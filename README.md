This repository includes a few sample scripts for review by hiring managers or selection committee. Please consider these as samples that I can share outside my group; these are just to give an idea and are not true indicator of my expertise in programming langugaes.

Study-specific (major) tools that I developed cannot be included here as those are only for internal use.



## Python Scripts in this repository

**4_layer_born-effective_calculation.py**: This script parses ouput porduced by VASP and calculates born-effective charges for any 4 layer superlattice.

**pol_vasp.py**: Parse VASP output and calculate polarization using theory of polarization. 




## Convolution library for XAS 
This small library convolutes the XAS spectra produced from experiments and molecular dynamics calculations 




## Lautrac wrapper
Wrapper scripts in this direcotry performs following tasks
  - Pre-process input files
  - iteratively submits jobs on massively parallel clusters
  - parses ouput
  - post-processes outputs
